Data feeds used for automation systems and real time info& also a list of known bad indicators ie domain names, IPs, etd . Narrative reports provide info but needs to be done manually. Sec intel provides insights into the security status of those systems. 
CTI provides data about the external threat landscape like hacker groups, zero day, etc.                                  

 AT&T is open source intel , IBM-Xforce, Recorded future and fireeye is closed source             CTI over HTTPS in using REST via API is TAXII

Hospitals can use info of ISAC that can help detect threats better is Adding new rules for monitoring, Create definitions of TTP.             Measure total attack surface of a corporate network by attack vectors.  IOC is a measure of a successful attack. Impact analysis is to assess cost with an incident.                

CVSS is measured by Access complexity and user interaction.                   
Correlate IoC into attack patterns, analyst can identify several TTPs → This represents behavior threat research.     
Reputational threat research identifies IPs and DNS domains              
If you review a list of vulnerabilities on the network, operational level you would identify priorities for remediation, strategic point you would Identify unrecognized sources of vulns.  Primarily based on RIsk management. 

Scanning outside the firewall or IPS  will miss a lot of the true risks & vulns therefore false negatives.     
Security framework or checklist of controls & configurations settings is to set Compliance. 

Check for fingerprinting → host system detection maps open ports, files hares running services , foot printing → Layout of network               man-in-the-middle tool that exploits name resolution → Responder                  
pentest tool with ability to craft network packets to exploit vuln firewalls → HPING             Hashcat → password recovery tool.   Reaver → Designed to exploit WPS.        Prowler → Audit tool specific to AWS evaluate cloud instances.  

Enumeration tools, nmap, etc as well as wireless tools and attacks.    namp -sL → perform reverse-DNS, Business vuln scanner for small networks → Nessus,     OpenVas → Open-source software available for src code or pre-complied packages,     Qualys is a cloud-based service,     Pacu exploit framework to test security configs of AWS account.     
     Nmap output options will result in a human readable output → Interactive       normal out is directed to a file, XML out put is achieved by -oX,   Grepable output delimits the output using one line                         Aircrack-ng: uses airplay-ng inject frames  to perform a deauth attack by forcing victim to reauth.        airodump-ng → captures 802.11 frames to identify MAC addresses.   airmon-ng → monitor mode.               packets transmit to an app while using unexpected values in a payload → Fuzzing via protocol.              A file format fuzzer attempts to open files whose format has been manipulated.
